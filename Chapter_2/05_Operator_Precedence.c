// 3 * x - 8 * y will be (3x) - (8y) or 3(x - 8y)?

// In C language simple mathematical rules like BODMAS no longer apply.

// The answer to the above question is provided by the operator precedence and associativity.

/*
The following table lists the operator priority in C:

// operators of higher priority are evaluated first in the absence of paranthesis (Brackets).
