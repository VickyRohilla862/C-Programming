// Control Instructuons determines the flow of control in a program.

/*
There are 4 types of control instructions:
    1. Sequence control instructions (The code will be executed in the sequence in which the code is written)
    2. Decision control instructions (Instructions that are used to make decisions. eg: if-else statement)
    3. Loop control instructions (Instructions that are used to run a code in a loop for specific number of times. eg: for loop, while loop, do-while loop)
    4. Case control instructions (a type of multi-way decision control statement that executes a specific block of code from several possibilities based on the value of an expression. Unlike if-else which handles one or two conditions, the switch statement allows you to handle multiple distinct outcomes in a clean and efficient way, especially when the decision is based on matching a single variable to a set of constant integer values. eg: switch statement)
