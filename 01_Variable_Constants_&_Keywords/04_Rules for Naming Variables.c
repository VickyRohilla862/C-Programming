// A variable may consist of letters, digits and underscores(_)

// The first character must be a letter or underscore

// Special symbols and blank spaces are not allowed.

// Keywords or reserved words are not allowed. 

/* Both uppercase and lowercase letters are allowed and are considered to be distinguishable
example: The variable SUM is not same as sum or Sum.
*/

/*A variable name may be as long as you wish, but the first 8 characters of a variable are recognized by C compilers.
The variable name "accountsbranch" and "accountoffice" would be regarded as identical variables in C.
example: 
    int a; and int A; are not same.
    int a; int b; int c; int cab; int vicky; is allowed.
    int vicky is good; is not allowed.

/* Note:
    We must create meaningful variable names in our program. This enhances readability of our program.

    These variables are stored in our RAM(Random Access Memory)
