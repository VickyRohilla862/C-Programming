/*
There are two types of functions:
1. Library or Pre-Defined Functions: Commonly used function grouped together in a library file or disk.
2. User Defined Functions: These are the functions declared and defined by the user.

/*
WHY USE FUNCTIONS?
1. To avoid rewriting the same logic again and again.
2. To keep track of what we are doing in a program
3. To test and check logic independently.
