/*
FUNCTION PROTOTYPE:
    A function prototype informs the compiler about a function that will be defined later in the program.
    The void keyword indecates that the function doesn't return anything.
*/
/*
FUNCTION CALL:
    Function call instructs the compiler to execute the function's body when the call is made.
Note:
    The program execution starts from the main function but when the function call is encountered, the program runs the function a user made.
*/
/*
FUNCTION DEFINITION:
    This part contains the exact set of instructions executed during the function call.
    When a function is called from main(), the main function pauses temporarily.
    During this time, control transfers to the called function.
    Once the function finishes executing, main() resumes.
*/

/*
Important Poitns:
1. Execution of a C program starts from main()
2. A C program can have more than one function
3. Every function gets called directly or indirectly from main()
