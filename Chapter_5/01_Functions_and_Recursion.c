/*
Somtimes our program is too big to keep track of a specific piece of code.
Or sometimes we want to use a large code multiple times and places in a program.
In these cases, instead of finding a code or writing a code again and again, we use functions.

Basically, function is a way to break our code into chunks so that it is possible for a programmer to reuse them.
