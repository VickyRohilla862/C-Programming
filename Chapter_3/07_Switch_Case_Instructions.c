// Switch case is used when we have to make a choice between numbers of alternatives for a given variable
/*
syntax:
    switch (integer_expression){
        case c1:
            //code
        case c2:
            //code
        case c3:
            //code
        default:
            //code
    }
*/
// The value of integer expression is matches against c1, c2, c3. If it matches any of these cases, that case along with all subsequenced "case" and "default" sattements are executed.
