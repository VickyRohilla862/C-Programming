Sometimes we want to watch comedy videos on YouTube if the day is Sunday.
Sometimes we order junk food if it is our friend's birthday in the Hostel.
You might want to buy an Umbrella if it's raining outside and you have the money.
You order the mea if Dal or your favourite dish is listed on the Menu.

All these are decisions which depends on a condition being met.

In C language too, we must be able to execute instructions on a condition(s) being met.
