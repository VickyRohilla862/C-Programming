/*
Consider this array:
    int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3}; // 1 integer = 4 bytes
This will reserve 4 X 3 = 12 bytes in memory (4 X number_of_elements_in_array for integer)
(4 bytes for each integer)
1 byte will be reserved for each element in a character array or string
similarly, 4 bytes for each element in a float array will be reserved in the memory

Check out the image 'Array_Memory_Location.png' for better understanding!!
