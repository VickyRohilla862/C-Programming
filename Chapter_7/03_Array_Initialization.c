/*
There are many other ways in which an array an be initialized
    int num[3] = {9, 8, 7}; // arrays can be initialized while declaration

    float marks[] = {34, 40};   // we can initialize an array without giving its size.
    This method is used when we don't know how many elements we want to add in the array.
