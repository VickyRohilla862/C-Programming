/*
An Array is a collection of similar elements.
Arrays allows a single variable to store multiple values

Syntax:
    int marks[90];  // integer array
    char name[20];  // Character array
    float percentage[90];   // float array

The values can be assigned like:
    marks[0] = 45;
    marks[1] = 60;

Note:
    It is very important to note that the array index starts with 0.

in int marks[90], we can store 90 ionteger values but the index will be counted from 0-89 because index starts with 0.
If index was started with one then the index would have been counted like 1-90.
