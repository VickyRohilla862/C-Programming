/*
1. Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number 'n'.

2. Write a program to print multiplication table of 10 in reverse order.

3. A do-while loop is exacuted:
    a. At least once
    b. At least twice
    c. At most once
// a. At least once

4. What can be done using one type of loop can also be done using the other two types of loops - true or false?
// true

5. Write a program to sum up ten natural numbers using while loop.

6. Write a program to implement program 5 using (i) for loop and (ii) do while loop.

7. Write a program to calculate the sum of the number occuring in the table of 8.

8. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for loop.
// factorail of 4 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4
// factorial of 8 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8
// factorial of 0 = 1

9. Repeat 8 using while loop.

10. Write a program to check whether a given number  is prime or not using loops.
// the numbers that can only be divided from 1 and itself are prime numbers
