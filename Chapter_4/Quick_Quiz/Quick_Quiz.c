/*
1. write a program to print natural numbers from 10-20 when initial loop counter is initialized to 0.
The loop counter needs not to be int, it can be a float also.

2. Write a program to print first "n" natural numbers using do-while loop.
    eg: input: 4
        output: 
            1
            2
            3
            4

3. Write a program to print first "n" natural numbers using for loop.

4. Write a program to print "n" natural numbers in reverse using for loop.
