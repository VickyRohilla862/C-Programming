/*
Sometimes we want a part of code to run multiple times but the number of time we want to run that code is higher than we can do it manually.
In that case loops comes in handy.
For example:
    We want to print "Happy Birthday" 10 times. You can do it by using printf function 10 times like this:
*/

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    printf("Happy Birthday!");
    return 0;
}

/*
But what if I ask you to print it 100 times or 200 times?..
You'll probably say "Are you serious?" But i am serious.. what will you do?
Here you can use loops.
Hence, loops makes it easy for a programtp tell the computer that a given set of instructions must be executed repeatedly.
