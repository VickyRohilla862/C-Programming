/*
These are the shorthand operators fro some calculations and assignments.
For example:
    instead of writing i = 2; i = i+4;, we can write i = 2; i += 4;
    both works same!

/*
Some compound assignment operators are:
    1. +=       2. -+       3. *=       4. /=
    5. /=       6. >>=      7. <<=
